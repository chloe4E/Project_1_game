## Description

In this game, the player is given a square of a random color (blue, green or pink).<br>
With a basic steering wheel, the player can orient the square into 7 different angles.<br>
With the space bar the player can launch the square.<br>
If the player-square hits a square of the same color, they both pop-up - as well as any adjacent square of the same color.<br>
If after the pop, a square is not in contact with any other square, it will also pop.<br>
<br>
You can play the game in <a href="https://chloe4e.github.io/Project_1_game/" target="_blank">GitHub pages</a>

## Challenges

In the original Frozen Bubbles game, when (after a hit) a sequence of bubbles are not connected to the top of the canvas, they disappear.<br>
This step is very challenging to implement in the current state of the game.<br>
Any insights on this would be welcomed.<br>
