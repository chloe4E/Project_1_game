This game was developed in my third week of the Ironhack bootcamp.
It is written in vanilla javascript and is inspired by the game Frozen Bubbles.

## Description

In this game, the player is given a square of a random color (blue, green or pink).
With a basic steering wheel, the player can orient the square into 7 different angles.
With the space bar the player can launch the square.
If the player-square hits a square of the same color, they both pop-up - as well as any adjacent square of the same color.
If after the pop, a square is not in contact with any other square, it will also pop.

You can play the game in GitHub pages

## Challenges

In the original Frozen Bubbles game, when (after a hit) a sequence of bubbles are not connected to the top of the canvas, they disappear.
This step is very challenging to implement in the current state of the game.
Any insights on this would be welcomed.
